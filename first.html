        Programming!
        Lets start with the basics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Variables: These are labelled storage places for values.</li>
        <li>Program Flow: Code is executed sequentially however there are ways of jumping around code, like choose your own adventures, sorta.</li>
        <li>Functions: These organsise code into named blocks. Like the square root function, or the sine/cosine functions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And now you can program!
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay so lets look at some real (simple) code. This is come C# code, it the same stuff I use at work and the same stuff used by the Unity game engine to make games like Kerbal Space Program and Cities: Skylines. I decided that the most interesting that I can start with is the Unity engine, there are going to be more keywords and unknown things thrown at you from the tsart, but you'll be able to make interesting things almost straight away.
      </p>
      <pre>
using UnityEngine;

public class HelloWorld : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () 
    {
        int age = 24;
        Debug.Log(age);

        int newAge = AddOne(age);
        Debug.Log(age);
        Debug.Log(newAge);
    }
	
    int AddOne(int input)
    {
        return input + 1;
    }
}</pre>
      <p>
        So here we have this really simple script, the code within the <code>void Start()</code> function is run when the script is run for the first time. Here we have an example of setting a variable value, displaying that value to the Debug console and then calling a function.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also an example of making our own function <code>int AddOne(int input)</code> that simply takes the value you give it and returns that value plus one. In addition you can see that <code>age</code> is not affected when it is passed to <code>AddOne</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's our first program, it doesn't really do anything, but it already touches on a bunch of important things, basically declaring variables and calling functions.
