        <p>
          Alright! Lets aim to make a super simple text adventure game! Don't worry, this doesn't require any fancy. The solution I've made is considered 'complete', in that I've taken many different combinations of game state into account that aren't really necessary.
        </p>
        So first thing we'll need is some basic UI to test with and some extra files. So we'll need:
        <ul>
          <li>A blank adventure.js file and script tag linking it.</li>
          <li>A blank adventure.css file and a link tag linking it.</li>
          <li>A nice big header welcoming the player to adventure.</li>
          <li>An input for getting the players name.</li>
          <li>A button for starting the game.</li>
          <li>A div for displaying all the game world text</li>
          <li>An input for getting player input.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>
  </body>
