        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Lets create a simple RPG!
        </p>
        <p>
          First we need to break down some basic aspects of an RPG so that we figure out what we're going to do and how we're going to do them.

          <li>Music and sound</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So lets look at each part in more detail about how we should approach each part.
        </p>

        <h3>Game World</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different ways to represent a game world, the number of dimensions (from 1 upwards) need not be a limiting factor. 
          Neither how they're represented, either in chunks like a grid, hexes or voxels (3d pixels). 
        </p>
        <p>
          With so much to choose from we're going to stick with the reliable and much simplier to work with 2d square tiles world.
          And while this isn't necessarily tied to the game world, we're also going to be making the game turn based.
        </p>

        <h3>Game Characters</h3>
        <p>
          Different games deal with characters in different ways, and for different reasons. Many games take a different approach for the
          player and for NPCs and enemies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Take Diablo for example, the player has a set of stats, an inventory and equippable body parts.
          However the enemies have their own stats, no inventory and no equippable slots. Their stats are
          essentially pre-defined and not reflective of whatever items they might be appearing to hold. 
          This gives the game developers a lot of control over how much of a threat they are, however it does
          create a disconnect because the stats of the enemies aren't controlled by what they're wearing in their graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is in contrast to how Fallout or The Elder Scrolls typically work.
          All the characters in that world do have equippable slots, inventories and generally speaking
          their stats are determined by their equipment which you can see them holding. I would assume there's
          some additional fudging of enemy stats to make them more or less of a danger to the player but for
          the most part an enemy is setup basically like a player. The same is true for NPCs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tend to lean more towards the Elder Scrolls and Fallout way of doing things. Where the only real difference
          between the player and other NPCs is the code that controls the player object and what the game camera is following.
          This also has some advantages where anything that you allow the character to do, NPCs can do as well, and vice versa.
        </p>

        <h3>Skills and Stats</h3>
        <p>
          Skills and stats are a big part of any RPG since they're abstractions of what an item or character in a game world can do.
          This means that the amount of work you want to put into your skills and stats is pretty open ended.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sake of simplicty we're going with a system that doesn't involve any skills other than the ability to move and attack,
          and stats are minimal as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Player Progression</h3>
        <p>
          Another big part of an RPG is progression in some form. For the sake of simplicty we're going with a more Diablo like system where
          items make up the majority of your progression but without any skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Story and Setting</h3>
        <p>
          In short, no story here, because one isn't needed for an example. However that wouldn't fly for making a real game for the most part.
        </p>

        <h3>Player Input</h3>
        <p>
          Another thing that in todays world is becoming more open ended with motion controls, VR, AR, touch screens. 
          Our game is going to be pretty simple being a top down 2d turn based game, but along with this simplicity 
          means that we could in theory use just about any input scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're going to keep things simple go with keyboard controls for moving and mouse controls for dealing with items. 
        </p>

        <h3>Sound and Music</h3>
        <p>
          Another important part of any game, that we're going to skip over for the most part. But we could come back to it at a later date since
          handling playing back music and short sound clips is quite easy with modern HTML and Javascript.
