    Programming concepts

      <li>Statements</li>
      <li>Variables</li>
      <li>Program Flow</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
      <li>Data Structures</li>
      <li>Problem Solving</li>
      <li>Logic</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Knowing these concepts are the foundation of programming. Learning the syntax of a particular language is the easy part, knowing how to use these concepts is the hard part.
    </p>

    <p>
    So lets start with some of the basic concepts. Variables and programming flow are kind of both needed at the same time for things to make any sense.
    </p>

    <h1>Statements</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
      Lets start right at the begining, what is a statement? In the language we're going to look at C# it's everything between two semi-colons (;). These statements make up the 'sentances' of the code, you can combine multiple operations into a single statement, but you don't want them getting too long as it can be awkward to handle.
      A single statement is not a single line of code either. In this code there are two statements;
      </p>
      <pre>
      string name = "Beth";
      int age =
                26; </pre>
      <p>
      While the second line is a bit awkward it is still a single statement even though its goes over two lines. Multiline statements are something to be aware of as when a single statement gets too long it can make sense to break it up over multiple lines, or into multiple statements. For now though I'm just going to stick with simple statements that won't need multiple lines.
      </p>
      <h3>Declaration Statement</h3>
      <p>
      The statement shown above is called a declaration statement, as it declares that a variable exists, with a specific type and an optional starting value. Declaration statments have the general structure one of the two:
      </p>
      <pre class="cs">
      VariableType1 variableName1;
      VariableType2 variableName2 = startingValue;</pre>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>
      Whilst not quite statements as such, they allow code to contain notes that can be used to describe what the code is doing in human language. These are useful just for you as the developer to keep track of what you've written and important for other developers who are looking at your code.
      </p>
      <pre>
    // This is a single line, anything after the // is considered a comment until a new line is reached.
    /* This is a block comment, anything between the 
    starting slash star and an ending star slash will be 
    considered a comment and ignored by the computer. 
    As such
    string name = "Beth";
    is just a comment right now, so you can use comments to temporarily disable code as well.
    */ </pre>
    </div>

    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
      At the high level variables can be thought of as boxes with labels that contain data. Each box has a type associated with it and that box can only store values that are of that type in it.
      </p>
      <h3>Variable Types</h3>
      There are two main groups of types, primative and complex (sometimes called compound types). Lets just look at primative types first:
      <p>
      Now what do they mean!? Well internally in the computer each of those are just ones and zeroes, generally made up of either 8, 16, 32 or 64 ones and zeroes (ones and zeroes are generallly called bits, eg: 32-bit, 64-bit, etc). So it's up to us as the programmer to say what we want to do with those bits or rather, what those bits mean.
      </p>
      For the sake of simplicity I will stick to using <code>int</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>bool</code> for now as the other values are pretty much just variations on those types anymway.
      <ul>
        <li><code>int</code>
        <p>
        int is short for integer which is the math term for a whole number, so no decimal points with this type. They are fast, small, accurate (if you're using whole numbers) and generally one of the most common types. In C# they are 32-bit which means they can store a value range between -2147483648 and 2147483647 or [-2^31, 2^31 - 1]. Why minus one? That's honestly not super important right now, but just know that there are rules associated with how the number is stored and limitations on the size of the numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example:
        <pre>
          int age = 26;
          int year = 2015;
          int pi = 3.14159; // &lt;-- Invalid! Because pi is not an integer value </pre>
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><code>double</code>
        <p>
        double is short for double precision floating point number, which just means that it's a number that can have a deciaml value. The double precision part means that it can store larger and more precise numbers than the <code>float</code> type. It's a number type that has a certain accuracy, so at large numbers, adding 1 to that large number will not do anything. Or in the reverse case, having a small number and then adding a really big number and then subtracting that big number will result in the small value you had being lost. Again the specifics are not important but know that there are limitations.
        </p>
        For example:
        <pre>
        double age = 26; // &lt;-- This is valid because 26 is the decimal number 26.0
        double pi = 3.14159;
        double bigNumber = 1000000000005; // &lt;-- This will be rounded to about 1e+12 </pre>
        </li>
        <li><code>bool</code>
        <p>
        bool is short for boolean which I'm pretty sure is the name of the guy who invented Boolean math, which is the math based around true and false only values. So a bool can only store either true or false, there isn't really any other surprises with bools than that.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example:
        <pre>
        bool connected = false;
        bool notWorking = 5;         // &lt;-- This is invalid, although it can be converted to a bool value.
        bool working = (bool)5;      // &lt;-- This is valid as any number above 0 when converted to a bool is considered true.  </pre>
        </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Okay this is pretty brief on variables since we need to move onto program flow to really make use of variables and we'll come back to the details of variables.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Casting (or type conversion)</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
      With all these different types often you're going to need to combine different types together, like adding an <code>int</code> to a <code>double</code>. In some cases values will be converted for you where it makes sense to the computer, usually when combining a type that can hold a small balue being added to a variable that can hold a larger variable and it'll cast the smaller type up to the larger type. However if you're going the other way you need to explicitly cast, this is pretty much telling the computer that you know what you're doing and that you know that potentially going to a smaller variable type might result in data being lost.
      </p>
      <p>
      For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        double ageWithDecimal = 56.7;
        int age = ageWithDecimal; // &lt;-- Invalid as double to int will loose data so you need to explicitly say that it's all good.
        age = (int)ageWithDecimal // &lt;-- Valid and will drop the decimal part (not round) so it will be 56, not 57.</pre>
    </div>

    <h1>Program Flow</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
      So on their own variables don't do anything, you need something to execute instructions. Code is often compared to recipe instructions which is pretty true, however instead of a person interpreting a list of relatively vague instructions you have a computer executing very precise instructions.
      </p>
      Each code statement does one or more things.
      For example:
      <pre>
      string name = "Beth";
      int age = 43;
      string email = "example@what.com"; </pre>

      <p>
      In this case, we have 3 declaration statements. Before any of this code has run the computer has no knowledge the variables <code>name</code>, <code>age</code> or <code>email</code>. As each declaration statement is executed it creates space in memory for each variable and puts the value on the right hand side (after the = sign) into the space owned by those variables.
      </p>

      <p>
      So each statement is executed one after the other sequentially (not actually 100% true but for now you can assume that is the case). However to do anything complicated you need to be able to re-use and rerun code, or conditionally run code, etc. For doing these things there are control statements:
      </p>

      <h3><code>if</code> statement</h3>
      The <code>if</code> statement is used to run code if a certain condition is met, eg:
      <pre>
      int pingTime = 1000;
      string status;
      if (pingTime &gt; 500)
      {
          status = "laggy";
      }
      else
      {
          status = "not too bad";
      } 
      Debug.Log(status); </pre>
      <p>
      Assuming that the value of <code>pingTime</code> was set by something dynamic instead of something statically set in the code, you use this code to see the current status value about the ping time.
      </p>
      <p>
      You may have also noticed that there is some more syntax going on, the use of curly brackets {}s and the greater than operator &gt;. The brackets tell the computer which sets of lines of code go together, like in this case you can put as many lines of code as you want within the first and second sets of curly brackets for executing code when the condition is false or true.
      There are also numerous operators for testing numbers, most are fairly self explanatory with a few exceptions that you probably won't need in most cases.
      </p>

      <h3><code>for</code> loop</h3>
      Now we're getting into some more complicated statements. The <code>for</code> loop is one of three looping statements but each are pretty much just for preference or easy of use in a given situation, all loops can be used interchangeably really. All loops follow the same basic structure, set some initial values, a condition to be met (like an <code>if</code> statement) and something to perform at the end of each loop iteration.

      <pre>
      int total = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 1)
      {
          total = total + i;
          Debug.Log(total);
      } </pre>
      <p>
      So what's going on here!? The <code>for</code> has the three parts to it, firstly is the <code>int i = 0;</code>, this creates a new variable just for this loop (not 100% true, this changes based on language but convention dictates that we assume that the <code>i</code> variable only exists in the for loop). We also have our condition <code>i &lt; 10;</code> which will allow the loop to run while <code>i</code> is less than 10. And finally we have our step <code>i = i + 1</code>, this is just another piece of code that is run each time the loop is executed.
      </p>
      I've also used a function <code>Debug.Log</code> functions are just more code but you can give them inputs, in this case I want to display the current <code>total</code> value to the screen somewhere. Assuming you ran this code in a browser you would see this output in the console.
      <pre>
      0
      1
      3
      6
      10
      15
      21
      28
      36
      45 </pre>
      <p>
      You can see that the code was executed ten times and gave us this list of numbers in the console.
      </p>
      I know this can be a lot of new things to take in so don't worry if you're still feeling pretty lost. But hopefully you have a rough idea on what variables are and that program flow is something that can be changed.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>Functions</h1>
      <p>
      Functions are another key concepts in programming and the concept is entirely taken from the idea of math functions.
      Thinking back to math, sine, cosine and tan were all functions and using them in code would look like this:
      <pre>
      double answer = sine(input); </pre>
      <p>
      Easy! So lets say we want to make our own function since we'll want to do that frequently. Lets make a really simple function that takes a number, increments the number and returns the new number.
      </p>
      <pre>
      int AddOne(int input)
      {
          return input + 1;
      }
      int x = 5;
      int y = AddOne(x); </pre>
      <p>
      So the value of <code>y</code> is now 6. Now there are several important things going on here: 
      <ol>
        <li>
        Firstly the value of <code>x</code> is copied into the value of <code>input</code> within the <code>addOne</code> function, since it's another variable that now has the same value, any changes made to the <code>input</code> value has no affect on the original <code>x</code> variable. 

        </li>
        <li>
        Secondly the variables created within the <code>addOne</code> function only exist within the function, so asking for the value of <code>input</code> outside the function will return <code>undefined</code>.
        </li>
      </ol> 
      <p>
      Lets try a slightly more complicated function that takes two arguments (inputs).
      </p>
      <pre>
      int z = 8;
      int Combine(int x, int y)
      {
          return x * y * z; 
      }

      int x = 5;
      int y = Combine(x, 9); </pre>
      <p>
      Now the value of <code>y</code> will be 360. You might notice that the names of variables have been used twice, however this doesn't cause problems because the variables inside the function 'shadow' the values outside the function. However variables outside the function can be referred to if a name hasn't been 'shadow'd as in the case of the <code>z</code> variable.
      </p>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Classes</h1>
      <p>
        So we've seen primative variable types but to do anything complicated we need more complicated types, for that we have classes. A class is a compound type that a developer can define themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets look at a simple class:
      </p>
      <pre>
      class Sword
      {
          public int MaxDamage;
          public int MinDamage;
          public string Name;
      }</pre>
      <p>
        This is a really simple representation of a sword item. We can use this class like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
      var sword = new Sword();
      sword.MaxDamage = 2;
      sword.MinDamage = 1;
      sword.Name = "Wooden Sword";

      var output = string.Format("{0}: {1} - {2}", sword.Name, sword.MinDamage, sword.MaxDamage);
      Debug.Log(output);</pre>
      This will output to the console:
      <pre>Wooden Sword: 1 - 2</pre>
      <p>
        So there are a few differences with classes as we can see. Firstly to use one we need to <code>new</code> an instance of the Sword class. Classes are created in a different part of the memory and you basically are asking for enough RAM required to fit an instance of the Sword class. In this case the Sword class does not take up much space but the size doesn't matter (not for the most part anyway).
      </p>
