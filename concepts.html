        Programming concepts
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Program Flow</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Data Structures</li>
        <li>Problem Solving</li>
        <li>Logic</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Knowing these concepts are the foundation of programming. Learning the syntax of a particular language is the easy part, knowing how to use these concepts is the hard part.
      </p>

      <p>
        So lets start with some of the basic concepts. Variables and programming flow are kind of both needed at the same time for things to make any sense.
      </p>

      <h1>Variables</h1>
      <p>
        At the high level variables can be thought of as boxes with labels that contain data.
        Lets use the common concept of a person and make some variables that can be attributed to a person.
        
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Phone Number</li>
        <li>Email</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Values can be assigned to these variables and then retrieved later, eg:
      </p>
      <pre>
      var name = "Beth";
      var age = 26; </pre>
      <p>
        This is an example of setting some variables with some values, don't worry about the exact syntax just yet. Only note that there are different types of values as <code>"Beth"</code> is a word and <code>26</code> is a number.
      </p>
      So what's happening here, the values of <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> start off as <code>undefined</code>. Then as code that executes the equals (=) operator, the program sets the value of the variables with those names to the values on the right hand side.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="value-box">name = undefined</div>
          </td>
          <td class="mono">-></td>
          <td>
            <code>
              var name = "Beth";
            </code>
          </td>
          <td class="mono">-></td>
          <td>
            <div class="value-box">
              name = "Beth"
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <div class="value-box">age = undefined</div>
          </td>
          <td class="mono">-></td>
          <td>
            <code>
              var age = 26;
            </code>
          </td>
          <td class="mono">-></td>
          <td>
            <div class="value-box">
              name = 26
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      
      <p>
        Okay this is pretty brief on variables since we need to move onto program flow to really make use of variables and we'll come back to the details of variables.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>Program Flow</h1>
      <p>
        So on their own variables don't do anything, you need something to execute instructions. Code is often compared to recipe instructions which is pretty true, however instead of a person interpreting a list of relatively vague instructions you have a computer executing very precise instructions.
      </p>
      Each line of code does one or more things, these are typically (depending on the language) anything between two semi-colons (;)
      For example:
      <pre>
      var name = "Beth";
      var age = 43;
      var email = "example@what.com"; </pre>
      Is the same as
      <pre>
      var name = "Beth"; var age = 43; var email = "example@what.com"; </pre>
      <p>
        For the purposes of readability and sanity people will write their code so that each statement is on a new line, however if you see multiple statements on the same line it's still valid because it's the semi-colon's that actually separate the lines. You could say that semi-colon's are like periods (.) and that the whitespace around those is for organising things logically.
      </p>
      So each line is executed one after the other sequentially (not actually 100% true but for now you can assume that is the case). However to do anything complicated you need to be able to re-use and rerun code, or conditionally run code, etc. For doing these things there are control statements:

      <h3><code>if</code> statement</h3>
      The <code>if</code> statement is used to run code if a certain condition is met, eg:
      <pre>
      var pingTime = 1000;
      var status;
      if (pingTime &gt; 500)
      {
          status = "laggy";
      }
      else
      {
          status = "not too bad";
      } </pre>
      <p>
        Assuming that the value of <code>pingTime</code> was set by something dynamic instead of something statically set in the code, you use this code to see the current status value about the ping time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have also noticed that there is some more syntax going on, the use of curly brackets {}s and the greater than operator &gt;. The brackets tell the computer which sets of lines of code go together, like in this case you can put as many lines of code as you want within the first and second sets of curly brackets for executing code when the condition is false or true.
        There are also numerous operators for testing numbers, most are fairly self explanatory with a few exceptions that you probably won't need in most cases.
      </p>

      <h3><code>for</code> loop</h3>
      Now we're getting into some more complicated statements. The <code>for</code> loop is one of three looping statements but each are pretty much just for preference or easy of use in a given situation, all loops can be used interchangeably really. All loops follow the same basic structure, set some initial values, a condition to be met (like an <code>if</code> statement) and something to perform at the end of each loop iteration.

      <pre>
      var total = 0;
      for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 1)
      {
          total = total + i;
          console.info(total);
      } </pre>
      <p>
        So what's going on here!? The <code>for</code> has the three parts to it, firstly is the <code>var i = 0;</code>, this creates a new variable just for this loop (not 100% true, this changes based on language but convention dictates that we assume that the <code>i</code> variable only exists in the for loop). We also have our condition <code>i &lt; 10;</code> which will allow the loop to run while <code>i</code> is less than 10. And finally we have our step <code>i = i + 1</code>, this is just another piece of code that is run each time the loop is executed.
      </p>
      I've also used a function <code>console.info</code> functions are just more code but you can give them inputs, in this case I want to display the current <code>total</code> value to the screen somewhere. Assuming you ran this code in a browser you would see this output in the console.
      <pre>
      0
      1
      3
      6
      10
      15
      21
      28
      36
      45 </pre>
      <p>
        You can see that the code was executed ten times and gave us this list of numbers in the console.
      </p>
      I know this can be a lot of new things to take in so don't worry if you're still feeling pretty lost. But hopefully you have a rough idea on what variables are and that program flow is something that can be changed.
    </div>

    <div>
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>
      Functions are another key concepts in programming and the concept is entirely taken from the idea of math functions.
      Thinking back to math, sine, cosine and tan were all functions and using them in code would look like this:
      <pre>
      var answer = sine(input); </pre>
      <p>
        Easy! So lets say we want to make our own function since we'll want to do that frequently. Lets make a really simple function that takes a number, increments the number and returns the new number.
      </p>
      <pre>
      function addOne(input)
      {
          return input + 1;
      }
      var x = 5;
      var y = addOne(x); </pre>
      <p>
      So the value of <code>y</code> is now 6. Now there are several important things going on here: 
      <ol>
        <li>
        Firstly the value of <code>x</code> is copied into the value of <code>input</code> within the <code>addOne</code> function, since it's another variable that now has the same value, any changes made to the <code>input</code> value has no affect on the original <code>x</code> variable. 

        </li>
        <li>
        Secondly the variables created within the <code>addOne</code> function only exist within the function, so asking for the value of <code>input</code> outside the function will return <code>undefined</code>.
        </li>
      </ol> 
      <p>
        Lets try a slightly more complicated function that takes two arguments (inputs).
      </p>
      <pre>
      var z = 8;
      function combine(x, y)
      {
          return x * y * z; 
      }

      var x = 5;
      var y = combine(x, 9); </pre>
      <p>
      Now the value of <code>y</code> will be 360. You might notice that the names of variables have been used twice, however this doesn't cause problems because the variables inside the function 'shadow' the values outside the function. However variables outside the function can be referred to if a name hasn't been 'shadow'd as in the case of the <code>z</code> variable.
      </p>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Value Types</h1>
      Now that we hopefully have some basic concept of variables, assigning the value of variables and some basic program flow, here are some more information about variables.
      As you saw above there are different types of values, for example <code>"Beth"</code> is a string, short for a string of characters, and <code>26</code> is a number.

      <p>
        Now there are generally a few basic primative types that are going to be common to nearly all languages as they relate to how CPUs work generally.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number (usually split into integer and decimal types, but not always)</li>
        <li>Boolean (true or false values only)</li>
      </ul>
      There are also more complex compound types that are essentially just a combination of those twos wrapped into one type, for example a Person type might look like this:
      <pre>
      var person = {
          name: "Beth",
          age: 26,
          email: "email.com"
      };
      console.info("Person: ", person.name, person.age, person.email); </pre>
      This would print to the console:
      <pre>
      Person: Beth 26 email.com </pre>
      <p>
        Now here's where things can get tricky to explain as all my example have been in Javascript for simplicity and the ability to use a browser for doing any code tests. However Javascript does like to do things a bit differently from other languages so while the concepts are still the same, the way things are done in the code might appear quite different so bare that in mind.
